== About me
I received my B.S. degree from  Department of applied mathematics at Guiyang University([http://www.gyu.cn GYU]) in 2013, Ph.D degree from Department of applied mathematics at Wuhan University([http://www.whu.edu.cn WHU]) in 2018. I visited visited Prof. [http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/ Bin Dong] at BICMR of Peking University([http://www.pku.edu.cn PKU]) from June, 2016 to Sep., 2017. Now, I am working at [http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/ BICMR] as a postdoc fellow.
