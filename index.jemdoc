I am a final year dual degree student at the [http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ Department of Electrical Engineering], [https://www.iitm.ac.in/ IIT Madras]. I am broadly interested in problems that lie in the intersection of electrical engineering and computer science - in particular high dimensional statistical and algorithmic problems.

I am fortunate to have [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rakri/ Dr. Ravishankar Krishnaswamy] as my master's thesis advisor. I am also fortunate to collaborate with [http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~vaze/ Dr. Rahul Vaze] and [http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~andrew/ Dr. Andrew Thangaraj].
