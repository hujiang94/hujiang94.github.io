== About me
I am an Assistant Professor at the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University. I received my Ph.D. from Peking University and have held research positions at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Harvard Medical School, and the University of California, Berkeley. My current research focuses on mathematical optimization and its applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
