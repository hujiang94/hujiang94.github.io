I am a final year dual degree student at the [http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ Department of Electrical Engineering], [https://www.iitm.ac.in/ IIT Madras]. I am broadly interested in problems that lie in the intersection of electrical engineering and computer science - in particular high dimensional statistical and algorithmic problems.
